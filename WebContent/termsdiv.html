<h1 class="pageHdr georgia">Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
<p class="colFooterText">We recommend that you carefully go through our Terms of Use, to better understand the different features of our service. By subscribing to the registration process at FrrndLease, Members accept all items in the Terms of Use and agree to abide by and be legally bound by the Terms of Use.</p>
<h3 class="hdr02 georgia">1. Eligibility</h3>
<p class="colFooterText">
ONLY USERS WHO ARE THIRTEEN (13) YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER MAY REGISTER FOR OR USE THE FrrndLease Service. The FrrndLease Service is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of thirteen (13). If you are between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18), you may use the FrrndLease Service only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms and any applicable additional terms. 
You need to provide a) address of residence b) mobile phone number &amp; and c) communicable email address to sign up with FrrndLease. However, FrrndLease reserves the right to accept or reject membership at its sole discretion. Membership is for personal use only. However, it can be transferred to any other individual’s name with explicit communication to FrrndLease. No member may re-lend items borrowed from FrrndLease at any time. Doing so will entail automatic cancellation of membership.</p>
<h3 class="hdr02 georgia">2. Plans &amp; Payment terms</h3>
<p class="colFooterText">By subscribing to a specific membership plan of FrrndLease, the member is explicitly agreeing to pay, in advance, the leasing fee attached to the plan plus and any other applicable fee or tax at the frequency specified by the plan. Any non compliance with the payment terms in spite of 2 reminders will attract a penalty of 10% per payment period of the amount due and may lead to cancellation of membership.</p>
<h3 class="hdr02 georgia">3. Leasing period and leasing fee</h3>
<p class="colFooterText">FrrndLease proposes a reasonable leasing period with a restriction on the number of items that a member can hold at any point in time. No penalty will be levied for delayed return of items. However, under specific circumstances where other library members have requested for and are waiting for a item/s for more than 10 days, FrrndLease reserves the right to contact and request members holding item/s to be returned. Members are requested to then return the requested item/s within five (5) days of such request. Leasing fees should be paid as per the plan. In the event a member does not renew his/her subscription the company reserves the right to terminate the membership of the member. All correspondence in this regard will be communicated to the email address of the member as submitted in the application form. Members are requested to update their contact details periodically when changed. Leasing fee paid in advance will not be refunded.</p>
<h3 class="hdr02 georgia">4. Lost or Damaged items</h3>
<p class="colFooterText">At FrrndLease, we take utmost care to maintain items in good condition. Any anomaly of damage if found should be reported to the delivery executive if the item is delivered at the door. Failure to check and/or report the same will be constituted as if the member has received a item in good condition. While returning the item, the deliver executive will check for any damage of item(s) and report to the member accordingly. The determination of a item being “damaged” will be at the sole discretion of FrrndLease. Members can choose to replace a lost or damaged item within 10 days or pay the 'Reasonable Replacement Value' (RRV) amount determined by FrrndLease. 

<h3 class="hdr02 georgia">5. Membership closure &amp; refund of deposit</h3>
<p class="colFooterText">To discourage ad-hoc and short term membership, members are required to comply with a minimum membership term of three months. For members who subscribe to plans with a refundable deposit, any premature closure of membership in less than three months from the date of sign-up, will result in the leasing fee for the remaining period of the mandatory term getting adjusted against the deposit. The rest of the deposit, however will be refunded. For members who subscribe to annual plans without deposit there is no refund applicable at the time of closure. Under extreme situations caused by non-compliance to the Terms of Use by member, FrrndLease reserves the right to terminate a membership for any or no reason without any refund.</p>
<h3 class="hdr02 georgia">6. Unclaimed Refundable Deposit</h3>
<p class="colFooterText">Upon expiry of membership, FrrndLease sends reminders over emails/sms to its members for renewal. Three months after expiry, FrrndLease reserves the right to classify the account as &#8216;Dormant&#8217; and initiate steps to recover cost of items and any unpaid leasing fee from the refundable deposit, if there is no action on the reminders, which would be communicated to the member through email/sms. Post this recovery, any excess deposit left in the account will be retained as &#8220;Unclaimed&#8221; refundable deposit for a period of 3 months and periodic reminders would be sent to the member to claim the same. After 12 months of expiry of membership, FrrndLease reserves the right to treat the member as &#8220;not reachable&#8221; and take appropriate action on the unclaimed refundable deposit if there has been no response from the member on the reminder communications.</p>
<h3 class="hdr02 georgia">7. Definition of an <span class="caps">item</span></h3>
<p class="colFooterText">Since the leasing fee is a flat rate and is not linked to the number of items read in a period, it is important to note that each title catalogued in FrrndLease gets the same treatments irrespective of size or cost.</p>
<h3 class="hdr02 georgia">8. Changes to Terms of Use</h3>
<p class="colFooterText">FrrndLease reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice, to change these Terms of Use in its sole and absolute discretion. The most current version of these Terms of Use can be reviewed by clicking on the “Terms of Use” located at the bottom of the pages of the FrrndLease.com website. The most current version of the Terms of Use will supercede all previous versions. Your continued use of our service after changes are made means that you agree to be bound by such changes.</p>
