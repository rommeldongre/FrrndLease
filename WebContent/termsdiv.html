                       FrrndLease proposes a reasonable leasing period with no restriction on the number of items that a member can hold at any point in time. 
					   No penalty will be levied for delayed return of items. However, when the owner of an item wishes to have their item returned, FrrndLease reserves the right to contact and request members holding item/s to be returned. 
					   Members are requested to then return the requested item/s within five (5) days of such request. Leasing fees should be paid as per the plan. 
					   In the event a member does not renew his/her subscription the company reserves the right to terminate the membership of the member. 
					   All correspondence in this regard will be communicated to the email address of the member as submitted in the application form. 
					   Members are requested to update their contact details periodically when changed. Leasing fee paid in advance will not be refunded.

					   While returning the item, the deliver executive will check for any damage of item(s) and report to the member accordingly.

                      To discourage ad-hoc and short term membership, members are required to comply with a minimum membership term of three months. 
					  For members who subscribe to plans with a refundable deposit, any premature closure of membership in less than three months from the date of sign-up, will result in the leasing fee for the remaining period of the mandatory term getting adjusted against the deposit. 
					  The rest of the deposit, however will be refunded. For members who subscribe to annual plans without deposit there is no refund applicable at the time of closure. 
					  Under extreme situations caused by non-compliance to the Terms of Use by member, FrrndLease reserves the right to terminate a membership for any or no reason without any refund.

                      Upon expiry of membership, FrrndLease sends reminders over emails/sms to its members for renewal. 
					  Three months after expiry, FrrndLease reserves the right to classify the account as ‘Dormant’ and initiate steps to recover cost of items and any unpaid leasing fee from the refundable deposit, if there is no action on the reminders, which would be communicated to the member through email/sms. 
					  Post this recovery, any excess deposit left in the account will be retained as “Unclaimed” refundable deposit for a period of 3 months and periodic reminders would be sent to the member to claim the same. 
					  After 12 months of expiry of membership, FrrndLease reserves the right to treat the member as “not reachable” and take appropriate action on the unclaimed refundable deposit if there has been no response from the member on the reminder communications.
