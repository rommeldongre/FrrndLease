                       The leasing period is set by the Owner/FrrndLease as 'Lease Term' which is typically for a Month (30days), a Season (3 months) or an Year (12 months). There is a restriction on the number of items that a member can hold at any point in time, and is derermined by the member's leasing history. Lease fee, unless explicitly stated, is by means of FrrndLease Credits only. However, some items may carry a monetary fee in addtion, at the discretion of FrrndLease and its Merchant network. In addition, depending on the Plan selected, there may be a flat Delivery Fee for items. All Delivery Fees cover the lease and return of items.
					   No penalty will be levied for delayed return of items, but it will be reflected in the user profile and may impact future leases by the member. When the owner of an item wishes to have their item returned, FrrndLease reserves the right to contact and request members holding item/s to be returned. 
					   Members are requested to then return the requested item/s within five (5) days of such request. 
					   In the event a member does not renew his/her subscription, if applicable, FrrndLease reserves the right to put the membership 'OnHold' or even terminate the membership of the member. 
					   All correspondence in this regard will be communicated to the email address of the member as reflected on the member's Profile. 
					   Members are requested to update their contact details periodically when changed. Leasing fee paid in advance will not be refunded.
