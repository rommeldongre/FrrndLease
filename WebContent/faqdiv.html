                        FrrndLease provides two complimentary services.<br>
						a)Storage Service: It allows you to store household things like kids toys, kitchen appliances and vacation items like cameras, that you use rarely or seasonally with trusted members for FREE.<br>
						b)Library Service: It also allows members to rent/borrow/lease household things belonging to friendly members (or our partner merchants) for 'credits' earned on the platform.
